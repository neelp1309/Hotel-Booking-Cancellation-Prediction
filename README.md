# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction üè®üìâ

## Overview
This project aims to predict hotel booking cancellations using historical reservation data from INN Hotels Group. High cancellation rates can lead to significant revenue losses, especially with last-minute cancellations. By leveraging machine learning and data analysis, we identify key drivers of cancellations and provide actionable insights to help the hotel reduce these risks.
